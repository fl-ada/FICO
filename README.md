# STAT3612 - Statistical Machine Learning
This is the collection of notebooks done in the course; practicing few ML techniques with some toy datasets.
Some of the assignments let me practice the lecture contents or play around the FICO dataset to finally do the course project.

The course was about comparing different methods of ML.
After self-study on EDA, project notebook had been revised with great improvement on the prediction accuracy.

## FICO data
- HelocData.csv : source file for analysis
- HelocDataDict.xlsx : features supporting details
- HelocDataDict2.xlsx : missing data explanation

## Assignments
### 1. Data modeling.ipynb
- use FICO data
- look through data
- divide into train and test sets
- choose top-5 features best explaining
### 2. Data analysis.ipynb
- use FICO data
- using top-5 features from assignment 1, run GAM using binning, piecewise-linear, penalized B-splines, etc.
### 3. Data Interpretation.ipynb
- use breast cancer dataset from sklearn
- try different classifier models
- choose the best one, run post-hoc interpretability analysis
## Project
- Analyse FICO data, may use insights from previous assignments
- choose best model
- Analyse interpretability of the final model
